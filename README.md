Data Processing and Analysis Project

1. Overview

  This project was completed in 2022 as part of a master's program in Embedded and Intelligent Systems. It provides a good demonstration of using NumPy and Pandas libraries for data processing and showcases how to display data in a meaningful manner.

2. Introduction
3. 
  This Jupyter notebook helped me to apply my knowledge of Python, including Pandas and NumPy, to explore questions of social relevance. For the project, I had to select datasets based on the following topics:

a) Climate change and its consequences
b) Health care and its consequences
c) Education and its consequences

  I had to combine multiple such datasets, extract some information from them, and visualize my findings.

3. Key Features
  Data Loading and Exploration: The notebook includes code for loading, exploring, and cleaning the data.
  Data Processing: Demonstrates the use of NumPy and Pandas for efficient data processing.
  Data Visualization: Showcases techniques for meaningful data visualization.
  
4. Files
  Final.ipynb: The main file containing all the code and explanations.
